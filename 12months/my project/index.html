That moment I was waiting for my new friend when I found this quote. And I really liked it. It was a great day.</h4>

				<p>In April I visited Hong Kong for the first time. I was in Hong Kong several times later, but that trip had pretty warm memories and emotions with mostly my personal experience as the other times I wasn't there alone. I can already say that Hong Kong is my favourite megacity so far; a city full of skyscrapers surrounded by tall mountains and water in perfect harmony with the surrounding nature, what’s not to love? 
				One of the best things about Hong Kong was the view of the mega city from Victoria Peak. The night views of the harbor and the city are really inspiring.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="txt_block6">
				<p>Probably my favorite part of Hong Kong is the mix of old and new it has going. While it has some of the nicest sky scrapers and modern buildings you’ll see anywhere, it’s managed to keep the older buildings and narrow alleys from its past. There’s that beautiful Hong Kong skyline up high, but down on the ground you can find areas that take you back in time with old, Chinese neon signs, markets, dirty alleys and plenty of character. Another interesting thing about Hong Kong is exploring the different worlds hidden within the narrow alleys. While being in such a developed international city, it immediately takes you back in time to a feeling of the Hong Kong of old.</p>

Xi'an is one of the oldest cities in China and there are a lot of historical places to visit, but we had only 3 days and couldn't devote time to all of them. The most unforgettable experience was our hiking up Mount Hua and meeting the sunrise at the top of its East Peak. The views at the top were breathtaking and the peaks piercing through the clouds... What a view!</p>

							<p>We really enjoyed our staying in Xi'an. This city is perfect for walking and having a trip into the mists and lores of Chinese history. There are some beautiful parks from the ancient times with excellent examples of old architecture to feel the atmosphere of the past. Beautiful, enchanting, relaxing and like no other. That's my impression on our small trip into a cradle of this ancient civilization.</p>

				<p>In June I spend a lot of time exploring Guanzhou and walking around its downtown. Modern buildings, including Guanzhou's Second Children's Palace, Guanzhou Opera House, TV Tower, Library and Guangdong Museum, with beautiful flowers and trees and always accompanied by the Pearl River. The park in the central square looks amazing. That's a great place just to pause and take a moment of peace. It is beautiful at all times of the day and throughout the whole year. The night views are amazingly beautiful. At night the ground is lit up and the surrounding buildings are all lit up with a colorful moving pictures.</p>

				<p>In July was my third visit to Hong Kong. The weather was perfect and my companion was great. So, we had a super nice time there. As usual there was Victoria Peak (The Peak) on my do list. We got a taxi to the top. There was an interesting mall with various attractions, but that wasn't the real top of the peak. We left the crowd behind and did a small hiking for heigher and quiter place. There was a solitary spot a bit further up the road. I found it during my first staying in HK and which I humbly named after myself as Kristina's Peak. We also visited Disneyland. It was amazing, we had so much fun. That was my favourite trip to Hong Kong.</p>

I tried some new food, we rided a VR roller coaster and visited a park with miniature-scale famous landmarks of the world. That was fantastic!</p>
